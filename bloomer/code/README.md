# Bloomer
A [ComicFury](https://comicfury.com) layout built on Bulma.

This is the code repository for Bloomer! You can install the codes by going to your Webcomic's management profile > **Edit Layouts**, and then copying/pasting the code into the corresponding sections. For example, the code in "overview.html" goes into the Overview tab and so on. Happy customizing!
